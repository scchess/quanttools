#### v0.5.2:
- `round_POSIXct` `days` units support added.
- IQFeed local storage `1min` to `day` period support added.
- `Processor` mark to market caclulation fixed. Draw down calculation changed to difference between maximum market value and current market value.
- Added [MOEX](https://www.moex.com/en/derivatives/contracts.aspx) futures and options trades data support. Use `store_moex_data` to initialize local storage with `moex_storage`, `moex_data_url`, `moex_storage_from` settings. Use `get_moex_futures_data`, `get_moex_continuous_futures_data`, `get_moex_options_data` to get data from storage.
- `Processor.GetSummary()` method now returns `sharpe`, `sortino`, `r_squared`, `avg_dd`.
- `GetOnCandleMarketValueHistory()`, `GetOnCandleDrawDownHistory()`, `GetOnDayClosePerformanceHistory()` methods added to `Processor`.

#### v0.5.1:
- `Processor` now operates in the same time zone as input ticks. Ticks `tzone` attribute must be specified.
- `to_ticks` function added. As it is easier to get one minute bars than ticks for time span of several years `to_ticks` provides convinient way to convert these bars to ticks. Note that back test results on approximated ticks will be less realistic but may be acceptable for some strategies.
